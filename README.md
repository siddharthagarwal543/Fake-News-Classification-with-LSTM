# Fake News Classification with LSTM
 This repository contains code for a machine learning model that uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to classify fake news articles. The model is trained on a dataset sourced from kaggle, which consists of labeled news articles indicating whether they are fake or not.
