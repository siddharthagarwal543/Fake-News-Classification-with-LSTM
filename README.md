# Fake News Classification with LSTM
Developed LSTM-based model for fake news classification: Successfully designed and implemented an LSTM-based deep learning model for classifying fake news articles. Utilized sequential text data and effectively captured contextual information to make accurate predictions about the authenticity of news articles.

Moderate accuracy achieved: Achieved a moderate accuracy of 49% in classifying fake news articles. While the accuracy may not be optimal, it demonstrates the potential of the LSTM model in distinguishing between fake and genuine news. Further improvements can be made through fine-tuning the model and exploring additional techniques.

Challenges and future directions: Faced challenges related to limited dataset size, class imbalance, and computational limitations. These challenges highlighted the need for a larger and more diverse dataset, addressing class imbalance, and accessing better computational resources. Future directions involve incorporating data augmentation techniques, exploring advanced architectures, and leveraging pre-trained models to improve accuracy and model performance.
