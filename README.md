# Fake News Classification with LSTM
 In this project, I developed a deep learning model for text classification using LSTM neural networks. The model was trained on a dataset of news headlines and was able to classify them into two categories with an accuracy of [insert accuracy score].

To preprocess the text data, I applied techniques such as removing special characters, converting text to lowercase, and performing stemming. I also used one-hot encoding and padding to prepare the data for input into the LSTM model.

The LSTM model architecture consisted of an embedding layer to represent the words, followed by dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The LSTM layer with recurrent dropout was employed to capture temporal dependencies in the text data. Finally, a dense layer with sigmoid activation was used for binary classification.

During training, early stopping was implemented to prevent overfitting and achieve the best performance on the validation set. The model was optimized using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.

Overall, the model showed promising results in classifying news headlines, achieving a [insert accuracy score]. The performance could potentially be further improved by exploring other techniques such as ensemble learning or hyperparameter tuning. This project has provided valuable experience in natural language processing and deep learning, showcasing my skills in text classification using LSTM networks.
